Building DAG of jobs...
The code used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-code-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-code-changes)'.
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 35 of /gpfs/scratch/jtl334/thesis/pipeline/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
expr_enriched_tfs.wgEncodeSydhTfbsGm12878Nfe2hStdAlnRep0.11mers.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
